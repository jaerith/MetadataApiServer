# MetadataApiServer
This project demonstrates how a C# web service can be driven and dynamically enhanced by metadata.  By adding and altering rows of metadata, we can introduce new functionality to both the web server and its mobile app client without writing additional code and without the need of redeployment.

# Requirements
* Windows 7 (at least)
* Visual Studio 2012 (at least)
* Sql Server 2012 (at least)
